// has migrated to Supabase for these services.
// It can be deleted if no other Firebase services are being used.

// Example of how it might look if you were still using other Firebase services,
// but not Auth or Firestore:
/*
import { initializeApp, getApps, getApp, type FirebaseApp } from "firebase/app";
// import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage"; // For example, if using Firebase Storage

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", // Still required for general app initialization
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
};

let app: FirebaseApp;
if (!getApps().length) {
  app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
} else {
  app = getApp();
}

// const storage = getStorage(app); // Example for Firebase Storage

export { app }; // Export 'app' or other service instances like 'storage'
*/

// For now, this file is effectively empty as its previous contents (Auth/Firestore init) are removed.
// Consider deleting this file if Firebase is completely removed from the project.
export {};
